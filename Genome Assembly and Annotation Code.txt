# We are going to first assemble our genome using Spades.

	spades.py -1 SRR33420661_1.fastq -2 SRR33420661_2.fastq -o spadesout

# Next we will also assemble our genome using abyss.

# We will make a new file called abyss out and move the assembly into that file. 

	mkdir abyssout

#a We will then use quast to create a summary table from the spades scaffold fasta file.

	quast.py spadesout/scaffolds.fasta -o quastspades

#We will then use quast to create a summary table from the abyss scaffold fa file.

# This code helps annotate the genome by getting information about the genes, rRNA sequence, and helps predict CDSs.

# Barrnap will help us extract the 16S rRNA sequence

	barrnap --kingdom bac spadesout/scaffolds.fasta > rRNAsequences.gff

# We will use bedtools to change the formatting from .gff file to .fasta file so we can use it on BLAST. 

	bedtools getfasta -fi spadesout/scaffolds.fasta -bed rRNAsequences.gff -fo rRNAsequences.fasta

# We now combine the two rRNA sequences and move them into a new folder called rRNA info.

	mkdir rRNAinfo

# This codes helps create a .txt folder for our neighbors species. 

	pico neighbors.txt

# We can put the fasta file of the neighboring species into that .txt file

#I then put my rRNA sequence into BLAST to see what bacteria I was dealing with and what neighboring species I had. 

#I then used my spades scaffold fasta file (as it produced a better quality of assembly) for Prokka (DOWNLOADED .tsv, .tbl, .gff, gbk, .faa),PathogenFinder2, and CARD (clicked on RGI tools then inputted my scaffold fasta file).
